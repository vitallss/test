 

You went fast to sleep
You wouldn't even talk to me
You said I'm so crazy
Coming home intoxicated
I said I just wanna love you
I just wanna love you baby
That is why I'm so elated

C'mon girl, give it to me baby
Give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby), I betcha
I'll make you hot till you've had enough
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
Just give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby), I betcha
I'll make you hot till you've had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff that funk that sweet that funky stuff (say what)
(Give it to me)
Give me that stuff that funk that sweet that funky stuff (say what)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff
That sweet, funky stuff
Yoh ho, aw
